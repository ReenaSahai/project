2x 100% SPY calls. Once on 434 and again on 435. That means I’ve won every day this week except Thursday. Net up is around I don’t know 50-60k for the week. All spy. All calls except Monday or Tuesday put. 200k capital roughly. Just buying whichever direction. Always expire daily except mon or tues was for the next day. 


This continues my chronicle of using small amounts of initial capital and mostly going all in on spy daily calls. Up to about 200k now from about 9k. 


Goal is just to keep going all in but I have quickly pulled back as the all in went over 100k . That’s bad because my original plan was to just snowball it over 20 trades or whatever at 20% avg to $3-4m. Already have about $1m and so would then just retire.",10/1/2021,Green_Lantern_4vr,9

"Weekend Discussion Thread for the Weekend of October 01, 2021","Some quick SPY stats to wet your dick - 

Historically, from 1986-2019, SPY's monthly 10% VaR (value-at-risk) is -4.6% and the CVaR past that is -7.2%. 

Translation for the retards: we can be 90% confident that SPY will not have a return below -4.6%, however when it does go below -4.6%, the average return is -7.2%. We ended the month with a -5.3% return which was below our 10% VaR but not as bad as the -7.2% average. This month's return was roughly a 2 standard deviation event (5% probability).

SPY also historically yields a 74% chance to have a positive monthly return, so the chance of two down months in a row is ~ 6.25%. 

Before you come at my ass saying how there are a lot of other variables to take into consideration, yes, I know. I couldn't think of anything to comment and whipped out a couple of stat calculations real quick but none of you retards should take these numbers literally.",10/1/2021,thecheese27,25

Oil has outpaced energy and rates by a fairly significant margin since mid June. You would think energy stocks and oil would be trading tighter together as they had really since COVID but for some reason there was this break in their relative correlation recently. 

Anyone have a theory? Leads me to believe we will see some regression to the mean from one or the other here at some point.

"Daily Discussion Thread for October 05, 2021","Something important that the frenzy of dramatic people obsessing over short term price movements might make you forget if you're here too much:

""Stonks only go up"" is faltering because we're waiting for budget decisions involving the money printers. Every day the market will wander around based on people's opinions on what decision will be made with the money printers, and if you have your own set opinion on what that decision will be, you can just keep betting on movement in that direction and the market will stop wandering around and go that direction for real when the decision is made and you'll make bank.

The daily SPY chart can help you optimize your buy in prices but you only need to really care what it's doing if you are making short-term bets swing trading on these fluctuations in opinion and hoping to successfully predict individual movements in where the market will wander around before it finds out what it's waiting to find out. This short term swing trading is higher risk and higher possible reward but it's not the only form of wallstreetbet you can do as an options trader.",10/5/2021,PlsDontNuke,5

Indicators coming into today’s release do point to a strong labor market, with the initial jobless claims number dropping and 51% of small businesses saying they had unfilled positions in September.

* Schumer: Wait!  I need to get a witness to make sure there is no funny business.

* Schumer walks over to Manchin engages in a short a lively conversation and then returns to McConnell with Manchin.

* Schumer:  As Manchin is my witness, 10million says you have square balls.

* McConnell: Check them yourself. And give me my 10 million.

* Schumer grabs them and then hands McConnell 10 million.  At which point Manchin burries his face in his hands and begins weeping uncontrollably.

* McConnell: What's his problem?

* Schumer: I just bet him 100 million I'd have you by the balls by the end of the day.

Lived through a prolonged low and slow meltdown.  Saw money just falling away.

But I clutched my bags tightly and cried myself to sleep.

Certain digital coins would rise in value, the amount of these mined by RIOT would increase significantly, but the share price would nonetheless continue its ride down. 

On Friday, I finally started to give up.  I did not sell any shares, but I sold covered calls on a significant portion of my holdings.  Deep ITM covered calls.  Basically, an exit strategy where I get burnt but not as bad as it could be.

Today, RIOT volume is... let's just call it elevated.  Nearly 4 million shares have been traded in the first hour of trading.  The price is already up over 6% on the day.  My covered calls?  Already down about $4k on the day.

RIOT looks like it may go into orbit.

However, $TSLA calls with 3 weeks or less still risk losing between 3 and 10 IV points.

If you want to hold through earnings, switch to longer maturities and go sufficiently ITM, because FDs will get destroyed. You can compute the expected impact of an IV crush vs the underlying move using online option pricers. Also to those holding stocks, selling covered calls isn't worth it, the IV is extremely low.

This isn't $NFLX which had a crazy IV run.

"Daily Discussion Thread for October 21, 2021","There's a front page post today about a guy who made $500k on the market, and this year pissed away the majority of it on TSM calls.

He was YOLOing hundreds of thousands of dollars on short term options and it was the bulk of his entire worth.

I mean... that's one of the few things left that makes WSB great. But I feel like that 500k was wasted on that individual. Give me the 500k next time.",10/21/2021,Turd-Lipstick,10

You guys should really do something about your security.

My account was breached today and I couldn’t do anything about it. A hacker logged into my account and bought 2000 shares of DWAC at $175.

This person knew my password, had access to my Face ID and my finger prints. The sick bastard even knew the name of my first pet and my mother’s maiden name.

I couldn’t believe it either. Someone needs to do something about this.

DWAC is now trading at $83.50 after hours and the position is down more than 50%.

Rent is coming up so I’m going to need my money back.

All had one thing in common less than 5 bill in market cap and they are high growth stocks (the ones where losses are almost equal to rev but who cared as they grow double digit right 😂 ). These stocks are all well below there 200 day and most near trading their lows. 

As rates start going higher and stocks are trading near lows it gives the companies very little room to manage there debt. Also Remember these companies recruit talent via stock options good luck retaining talent when stocks are in a free fall.

IMO these companies will either sell out or go bankrupt in coming months. Here is what I think is happening, Looks like market is starting to realize it and there sell off reflects it.
