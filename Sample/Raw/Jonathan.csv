70mil shares exist, 20 mil shares are institutional and untradeable. that 50mil left over (excluding naked shorts) is what is being fought over by the big guys.

The Short side is attacking the stock in a relatively smart way, getting it on the short restricted  list today rather than friday. If they can kill enough confidence, and fight a wall price at whatever undisclosed price they need it to stay below, friday when the Short Restriction is lifted they can attack even harder to shore up losses on options contracts for 3/12

What were are seeing is no doubt sell offs by BIG BIG money to crash price and recoup from the options market contracts. NOT HUGE RETAIL SELL OFF. We could never have this huge of an effect as what we are seeing today and and saw yesterday. were just smack dab in the middle of a battle between big boys with unfathomable money.

The upside is the Long Big Money is also likely waiting to see how much the short side is willing to let loose so they can buy it up. but timing is everything atm. that is why shorts were happy to see highs wednesday and no doubt planned for this to crash it wednesday. But, there is still many more moves to be made on both sides
