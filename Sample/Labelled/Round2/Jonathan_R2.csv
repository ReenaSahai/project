In it's purest form PLTR is very well made **data aggregation** platform. Forget all the AI bullshit, those people have no idea wtf are they talking about. Because those AI modules are build on top of the core platform kind of similar to plugin or extension.

Now I do believe that PLTR is the new Boeing. If you think for a second the current warfare is mostly digital and information. A good analyst/hacker with a laptop is more powerful than any battleship these days (those are just for shows). In the next 5 years, PLTR will be too important to fail for the US government just like BA before.
